A. Acceptance of Terms

By subscribing to the Dual Investment Services, you confirm and agree to be bound by and comply with these Dual Investment Terms (hereinafter referred to as the “Dual Investment Terms”), including any updates and amendments. Accessing or using the Dual Investment Services indicates that you have read, understood, and accepted the Dual Investment Terms, along with any additional documents or terms referred to herein. If you do not fully understand or accept the Dual Investment Terms, you should not use the Dual Investment Services.

B. Scope of Terms and Changes

These Terms specifically govern your access to and use of the Digital Asset “Dual Investment” services and any ancillary services provided by ExinOne (collectively referred to as the “Dual Investment Services”) in accordance with the Dual Investment Terms.

The Dual Investment Terms are supplemental to the ExinOne Terms of Service and should be read in conjunction with them. All provisions of the Terms of Service (unless explicitly modified in these Dual Investment Terms) are incorporated by reference and hold the same effect. The Dual Investment Terms constitute Product Terms. References in the Terms of Service to “ExinOne Services” include the Dual Investment Services described herein. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the Dual Investment Terms and the Terms of Service, the Dual Investment Terms shall prevail unless explicitly stated otherwise.

ExinOne may modify these Dual Investment Terms, or any referenced terms or information, at any time in accordance with the Terms of Service.

C. Disclosure and Consent

By subscribing to the Dual Investment Services, you agree to buy or sell specified Digital Assets at the Target Price you select on the Settlement Date. Your obligation to buy or sell is contingent upon the Target Price being reached. If the Target Price is not reached by the Settlement Date, you will not be obligated to complete the transaction. In other words, if the Settlement Price exceeds the Target Price in a “Buy Low Dual Investment” or falls below the Target Price in a “Sell High Dual Investment,” you will not be required to execute the trade on the Settlement Date.

Digital Assets used to subscribe to Dual Investments (“Subscribed DI Assets”) and the Dual Investment Rewards (“DI Rewards”) will not be segregated from other users’ assets. Subscribed DI Assets and DI Rewards will be stored collectively with other users’ assets within the Mixin Network.

During the Subscription Period, your Subscribed DI Assets will earn DI Rewards. These assets and all DI Rewards will be credited to your Mixin Wallet on the Settlement Date, either in the Deposit Currency or the Alternative Currency, in accordance with these Terms.

Please refer to the Risk Factor Statement for a non-exhaustive summary of potential risks associated with subscribing your Digital Assets to a Dual Investment.

ExinOne makes no representations or warranties that (a) Dual Investment is suitable for any user or region, or (b) the transactions and services described in these Terms are available or appropriate for any user or region. You are strongly advised to carefully read the Dual Investment Terms and seek independent professional advice to determine whether Dual Investment Services are appropriate for your personal circumstances, financial situation, and risk tolerance.

By accepting these Dual Investment Terms, you expressly, unconditionally, and irrevocably confirm that:
(a) You understand and accept full responsibility for participating in Dual Investment, including all associated risks as described in the Risk Factor Statement; and
(b) You have carefully assessed and determined that Dual Investment Services are suitable for you.

D. How to Participate in Dual Investment

To subscribe your Digital Assets to a Dual Investment, you must accept and confirm the following details on the platform:

a. The Target Price;
b. The Alternative Currency;
c. The Deposit Currency;
d. The amount of Digital Assets to be subscribed (denominated in the Deposit Currency);
e. The type of Dual Investment (Buy Low or Sell High);
f. The Subscription Date;
g. The Subscription Period;
h. The Settlement Date;
i. The DI Rewards.

If you meet the eligibility criteria determined by ExinOne, you may submit a Request for Quote (“RFQ”) as outlined in Clause 11. After submitting the RFQ, you will receive a Quoted Subscription detailing the terms of the Dual Investment Subscription. These terms may be refreshed periodically, and you are responsible for ensuring they meet your expectations. If you do not act within the validity period, ExinOne does not guarantee that you can proceed with the same or similar terms.

Once subscribed, you cannot withdraw the Subscribed DI Assets or DI Rewards until the Settlement Date.

E. DI Rewards and Settlement Date

DI Rewards will be calculated based on the applicable Annual Percentage Rate (APR), accruing from the Subscription Date, and will be credited to your Mixin Wallet on the Settlement Date. If the Target Price is not reached, the rewards will be settled in the Deposit Currency. If the Target Price is reached, they will be settled in the Alternative Currency.

F. General Terms

In case of any discrepancies between the translated version and the original English version of the Dual Investment Terms, the English version shall prevail.

By subscribing to Dual Investments or using the Dual Investment features on the platform, you authorize and appoint ExinOne as your agent to transact with counterparties on your behalf, using the Digital Assets specified in your ExinOne account for Dual Investment Services. ExinOne is authorized to take any necessary or appropriate actions to implement and manage your authorization, and to process your Digital Assets through the Dual Investment Services. You acknowledge and agree that ExinOne acts as a fully disclosed agent, not as a principal, in these transactions.

ExinOne reserves the right to terminate any Dual Investment subscription on or before the Settlement Date if it determines in good faith that exceptional market conditions or other events have caused significant dislocation in the Digital Asset market, making termination appropriate or necessary.
