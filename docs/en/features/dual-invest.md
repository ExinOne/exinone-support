## How Do “Buy Low” and “Sell High” Products Work?

Dual Currency Investment products are divided into two types: “Buy Low” and “Sell High.”

**Buy Low**

With Buy Low products, you have the opportunity to purchase cryptocurrency at a target price in the future. Regardless of market trends, you can still earn returns.

Example:
- BTC Current Price: $60,000
- Target Price: $50,000 (Buy BTC with USDT in two weeks)

Scenarios:
- Target Price Not Reached (Settlement Price ≥ Target Price): You won’t buy BTC, and your principal and returns will be paid in USDT.
- Target Price Reached (Settlement Price ≤ Target Price): You will use your principal and returns to purchase BTC at $50,000.

**Sell High**

With Sell High products, you have the opportunity to sell cryptocurrency at a target price in the future. Regardless of market trends, you can still earn returns.

Example:
- BTC Current Price: $60,000
- Target Price: $80,000 (Sell BTC to receive USDT in two weeks)

Scenarios:
- Target Price Reached (Settlement Price ≥ Target Price): You will sell BTC at $80,000, and your principal and returns will be paid in USDT.
- Target Price Not Reached (Settlement Price ≤ Target Price): You won’t sell BTC, and your principal and returns will be paid in BTC.

Risks of Dual Currency Investment

While Dual Currency Investment products are suitable for various scenarios and offer income potential, it is essential to understand the risks involved:
- Market Price Fluctuation Risk: The market may move in unpredictable directions, causing you to miss opportunities. If the market price drifts further from your target price, you may miss better buying or selling opportunities.
- Reduced Flexibility: Funds used for subscription are locked and cannot be used until the settlement date.

Important Note: Dual Currency Investment is not a risk-free product. Please read the product terms carefully before investing. ExinOne is not responsible for any losses caused by price fluctuations.
