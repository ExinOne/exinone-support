## Who is Dual Currency Investment for?

Whether you're an experienced trader or a long-term holder looking to earn additional income, Dual Currency Investment can suit a variety of scenarios. Here are the most common use cases:
- **Take Profit**: Sell your cryptocurrency at the target price to lock in profits and earn additional returns.

## How Do "Buy Low" and "Sell High" Products Work?

Dual Currency Investment products are divided into two types: "Buy Low" and "Sell High."

### **Buy Low**

With Buy Low products, you have the opportunity to purchase cryptocurrency at a target price in the future. Regardless of market trends, you can still earn returns.

**Example:**
- BTC Current Price: $100,000
- Target Price: $80,000 (Buy BTC with USDT in two weeks)

**Scenarios:**
- **Target Price Not Reached** (Settlement Price ≥ Target Price): You won't buy BTC, and your principal and returns will be paid in USDT.
- **Target Price Reached** (Settlement Price ≤ Target Price): You will use your principal and returns to purchase BTC at $80,000.

### **Sell High**

With Sell High products, you have the opportunity to sell cryptocurrency at a target price in the future. Regardless of market trends, you can still earn returns.

**Example:**
- BTC Current Price: $100,000
- Target Price: $120,000 (Sell BTC to receive USDT in two weeks)

**Scenarios:**
- **Target Price Reached** (Settlement Price ≥ Target Price): You will sell BTC at $120,000, and your principal and returns will be paid in USDT.
- **Target Price Not Reached** (Settlement Price ≤ Target Price): You won't sell BTC, and your principal and returns will be paid in BTC.

## Risks of Dual Currency Investment

While Dual Currency Investment products are suitable for various scenarios and offer income potential, it is essential to understand the risks involved:
- **Market Price Fluctuation Risk**: The market may move in unpredictable directions, causing you to miss opportunities. If the market price drifts further from your target price, you may miss better buying or selling opportunities.
- **Reduced Flexibility**: Funds used for subscription are locked and cannot be used until the settlement date.

**Important Note**: Dual Currency Investment is not a risk-free product. Please read the product terms carefully before investing. ExinOne is not responsible for any losses caused by price fluctuations.

## Practical Strategies for Dual Currency Investment

### Strategy 1: Sell High for Profit

Suppose BTC experiences a significant correction, and you seize the opportunity to buy the dip. At this point, you can look for a target price higher than your purchase cost and participate in a "Sell High" strategy:
- If the Sell High is triggered at maturity, you will sell BTC at a price higher than the market, receiving more USDT and generating additional income.
- If the Sell High is not triggered, you will receive more BTC as returns, increasing your holdings.

### Strategy 2: Buy Low to Replenish

Similarly, after selling BTC to obtain USDT, you can use these USDT to participate in a "Buy Low" strategy:
- If the Buy Low is triggered, you will repurchase BTC at a discounted price, achieving a lower-cost position.
- If the Buy Low is not triggered, it's equivalent to participating in a high-yield USDT financial product, earning additional stablecoin income.
